# Requirements

# Role Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `user_users` | List of users (see below) | `[]` |

## `user_users`

This is a list of dict. Keys of the dict are described below.

| Key | Description | Mandatory? |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| `name` | Name of the user | Yes |
| `arg`  | A dict of arguments supported by `ansible` [`user`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/user_module.html)` module | yes |
| `github` | if this key exists, add SSH public key found in GitHub to `authorized_keys`. | no |

Note that `name` in `arg`, if omitted, defaults to `name` in the dict.

When a user has '$HOME' directory, the role creates '$HOME/.ssh'.
